# simpleRockPaperScissors
Simple rock, paper, scissors game.

# How it Works?
A single player will face off a single enemy. At the start, the moves that the enemy will do will be determined randomly. Then, the player can choose a single move out of five (rock, paper, or scissors). The move will be then computed with a single logic of:
- paper will beats rock
- rock will beats scissors
- scissors will beat paper
The end result screen will be shown telling whether the player had won or lost.
